# Drop Rate

## Lars's Instructions

### Features

- Search input with dropdown
- Ping an API per keypress with text from the input
- Display results
- Select a result
- Store result in local storage
- Display result on page
- Option to remove result
- Option to leave rating on a result

### First Challenge

I’d start with just making the dropdown.

See if you can make the dropdown display a set of random strings as a result.

The dropdown should expand when there’s text inputted, the results should update on every keypress.

You should be able to click a result. The dropdown should close when you click elsewhere on the page, the dropdown should open again with the last results when the cursor is again entered into the input

### Notes

Everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS, total of 352 lines

In terms of UX it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, because I used the giphy API it would be better if an image preview was rendered instead of just a text-based list item. But the main point is to illustrate the techniques.
